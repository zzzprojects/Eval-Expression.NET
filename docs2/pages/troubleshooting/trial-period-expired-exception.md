> ERROR_005: The monthly trial period is expired. You can extend your trial by downloading the latest version. You can also purchase a perpetual license on our website. If you already own this license, this error only appears if the license has not been found. Contact our support team for more details: info@zzzprojects.com

## Solution

### Cause

- You are currently evaluating the library and the trial period is expired.
